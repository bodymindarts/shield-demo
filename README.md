# Shield demo

a quick introduction to shield running in habitat based docker containers.

[Shield](https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield) is a standalone system that can perform backup and restore functions for a wide variety of pluggable data systems.

You can deploy it via the [shield-boshrelease](https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield-boshrelease) or [habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/) based packages that can be found at [starkandwayne/habitat-plans](https://github.com/starkandwayne/habitat-plans)

## Demo

This demo is using the habitat based packages exported as docker containers and brought up via docker-compose.

Start the containers via
```
docker-compose up
```
